## ⚡ Understand Postbird in One Minute

**Postbird is a local-first AI inbox and office assistant for DeepSeek Harness.** It turns requirements scattered across messages, long threads, and attachments into actions, replies, trackers, and finished deliverables.

> **You say:** “Help me start today.”
>
> **Postbird delivers:** A daily brief, action radar, cited thread summary, reply drafts, collection tracker, and real `.eml`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`, and `.pptx` files.

Open the [Postbird Live Demo](https://xplore-lab.github.io/postbird/demo/), choose a campus role, and experience the full workflow without installing or signing in.

| Core experience | Say this | See this in one minute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily Brief | “Help me start today” | Priorities, deadlines, and replies that need attention |
| Action Radar | “Find every deadline, follow-up, and overdue request” | Ranked actions with owners, states, and source evidence |
| Context Reply | “Read this thread and prepare my reply” | Previous commitments, attachment requirements, and editable drafts |
| Collection Tracker | “Show who submitted and what is missing” | Complete, partial, and pending rosters with reminder previews |
| Attachment Q&A | “What format and deadline does the attachment require?” | Cited PDF pages, Word paragraphs, slides, and spreadsheet rows |

Every conclusion links back to its source. Outbound email always requires a preview and explicit confirmation.

## Seven Campus Roles

| Role | Say this | Postbird delivers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Undergraduate | “What must I complete this week?” | A campus action list spanning coursework, exams, applications, and replies |
| Graduate student | “What did my advisor ask me to revise? Draft a reply.” | Revision plan, attachment citations, meeting date, and grounded reply |
| Counselor | “Track scholarship materials and remind students with missing items.” | Submission tracker, missing items, reminder previews, and Excel export |
| Administrator | “Organize training registrations and create a report.” | Deduplicated roster, attachment index, Word report, and presentation |
| Instructor | “Summarize student email for this course.” | Assignment status, late requests, leave requests, replies, and archive |
| Professor | “Keep only messages that need my decision.” | Research milestones, collaboration decisions, approvals, and delegated work |
| Student organizer | “Organize activity registrations and materials, then show what needs attention.” | Registration tracker, duplicates, missing items, activity progress, and handover archive |

### Student activities, from registration to handover

Postbird can discover applicants from mail matching an activity subject, merge repeat submissions, check forms and supporting files, and continue through approvals, venue preparation, publicity, shifts, attendance, reimbursement, reporting, and annual handover.

## ✨ From Reading Email to Finishing Work

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/brand/postbird-readme-banner.png" alt="Postbird turns email and data into office deliverables" width="920" />
</div>

1. **Understand the inbox:** Classify messages and extract deadlines, owners, questions, commitments, and decisions.
2. **Recover context:** Group a whole thread and optionally fetch full text over read-only IMAP.
3. **Read attachments:** Retrieve cited evidence from PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and text files.
4. **Move communication forward:** Draft a grounded reply and show recipients, body, and attachments before sending.
5. **Track collection work:** Compare a roster with incoming mail, preserve human corrections, and export results.
6. **Deliver real work:** Produce standard email, spreadsheet, Word, PowerPoint, and archive files.

## Why It Feels Simple

| Experience | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| Natural-language entry | No tool names or manual orchestration to memorize |
| Seven role-based demos | Visitors immediately see a workflow that resembles their own work |
| Evidence on every result | Open the source message, PDF page, Word paragraph, slide, or sheet row |
| End-to-end delivery | Continue from reading and deciding to reports, documents, and archives |
| Configuration on demand | Demo and local documents work first; mailbox credentials come later |
| Human review | Low-confidence results are surfaced and every send requires confirmation |

## 22 Tools Working Together

| Capability | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Inbox and actions | `office_inbox_fetch`, `office_inbox_triage`, `office_daily_brief`, `office_action_radar`, `office_thread_summary`, `office_action_extract` |
| Replies and sending | `office_context_reply`, `office_reply_draft`, `office_mail_preview`, `office_mail_send` |
| Materials and attachments | `office_collection_track`, `office_attachment_ask`, `office_archive_search`, `office_archive_export`, `office_archive_attach` |
| Insights and organization | `office_stats_overview`, `office_stats_track`, `office_inbox_clean` |
| Office deliverables | `office_sheet`, `office_docgen`, `office_pptx`, `office_template` |

You can keep using natural language. Postbird composes these tools for each task.

## Five-Minute Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xplore-LAB/postbird.git
cd postbird
npm run setup
npm run doctor
```

Restart DeepSeek Harness and describe an outcome:

```text
Read this registration sheet, summarize it by department,
and create an Excel workbook, a Word report, and a presentation.
```

Try the local Office workflow without a mailbox:

```bash
npm run demo
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Connect a real mailbox, optional</strong></summary>

Postbird supports QQ Mail, 163, 126, Gmail, Outlook, and standard IMAP and SMTP services. Store app passwords in environment variables:

```bash
export DSH_IMAP_PASS="your-app-password"
export DSH_SMTP_PASS="your-app-password"
```

Then provide the mailbox address in the DeepSeek Harness `tool-office` configuration. Common services use built-in server presets. See the [English guide](docs/GUIDE.en.md#optional-mailbox-setup) for full instructions. Read-only inbox workflows and outbound delivery can be enabled independently.

</details>

## Safe by Default

| Design | Default behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Local first | Indexes, trackers, attachments, and generated files stay on your computer |
| Read-only inbox | IMAP uses a read-only lock and `BODY.PEEK`, preserving unread state |
| Minimal body retention | The index stores snippets; full text is fetched on demand and kept only in memory |
| Path confinement | Attachment reads, exports, and generated files stay inside the chosen work directory |
| Confirm before send | Postbird previews first and sends only after explicit confirmation |
| Human correction | Collection status and low-confidence decisions remain reviewable |
| Isolated credentials | App passwords come from environment variables and stay out of the repository |

See the [security policy](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and detailed boundaries.

Tool output enters the active DeepSeek Harness agent context. Before processing sensitive mail, confirm that your selected runtime and model meet your data requirements.

## Vision

Give every existing mailbox and local file collection a trustworthy, controllable, and deliverable AI office layer. Postbird helps individuals recover attention and helps teams turn collection, mail merge, archiving, handover, and reporting into reviewable workflows.
